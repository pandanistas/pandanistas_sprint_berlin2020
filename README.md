## How are we going to work during the sprint?
The day of the sprint we will upload docstring errors in pandas as issues in this repository. Each person will choose one (or more if time) to work on, and will submit the fix to the [pandas repository](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas). We will provide help and mentoring. You can choose to work in pairs as well.
